# Enterprise Architecture as a Strategic Partner

This repository provides practical frameworks, artifacts, and engagement models to help Enterprise Architecture (EA) functions mature into **strategic partners to the business**, not just technical authorities.

It is designed for:
- Chief Architects
- Enterprise Architecture leaders
- Business and IT strategists
- Transformation and planning executives

> "The value of architecture is not in the diagrams ‚Äî it's in the decisions it enables and the trust it earns with the business."

## Purpose

- Building an EA operating model aligned to **value delivery**
- Establishing **business-facing engagement practices**
- Influencing **investment, prioritization, and transformation**
- Measuring and communicating **EA impact**
